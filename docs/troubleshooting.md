## ⁉ Troubleshooting

* ##### I submitted my standup but it's not showing up in the report.

    Make sure you submitted the standup in the same channel as the report gets generated in.

* ##### I filled my standup report but had to make some changes to it. However, I'm seeing a blank standup form on opening it.

    Make sure you are in the same channel as you originally filled your standup it.
    
* ##### I'm seeing "Standup not configured for this channel" message on opening the standup modal.

    Make sure you are filling the standup in the right channel or that standup has been configured in the channel.
    
* ##### I'm seeing "You are not a part of this channel's standup" message on opening the standup modal. 

    You are not the part of current channel's standup. Make sure you are filling standup in the right channel or that you were correctly added to the channel's standup.
    
* ##### I'm seeing "No members configured for this channel's standup" message on opening standup modal.

    Make sure you've added some members to the channel's standup.
    
* ##### I'm seeing "Standup is disabled for this channel" message on opening standup modal.

    The channel standup is disabled. Run `/standupconfig` and enable standup from the modal that opens. 

* ##### I think the plugin is awesome and super cool.

    Hey, that's not a problem! It was designed that way 😎.
